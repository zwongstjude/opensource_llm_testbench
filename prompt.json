{"prompts": ["why is the sky blue?","Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which runner didn't have an increased heart rate? Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). The answer to this question is:", "Please answer the following question: Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly.

User: How does cryo-EM help GPCR structure determination?\n Assistant: ","You are an expert in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, and your task is to summarize the results of activity assays from an article in a tabular format. Please follow these steps to complete the task:\n1. Determine if the article includes an activity assay. If it does, locate the section(s) presenting the assay results, which are usually in one or more tables.\n2. Compile all the activity assay results into a single table. You may use multiple columns to represent different conditions or outcomes of various experiments.\n3. Identify the names or codes used in the table, such as Example 1 or Compound A, and find the corresponding sections in the article that mention these substances. Extract the full name and SMILES notation of each substance.\n4. Compile the names and SMILES notations of each substance in the table. Output in CSV format with multi-index (Affinities, protein/cell line), write units not in the header but in the value like '10.5 \textmu M'. Quote the value if it has comma! For example:\n‘‘‘csv\nCompound,Name,SMILES,Affinities,Affinities,Affinities,Affinities\n,,,5HT1A (IC50),5HT1D (IC50),5HT-UT (IC50),5HT1E (<affinity type>)\n'5a','Aspirin','CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O',2.0 nM,8.0 nM,12.6 nM,>1000 nM\n‘‘‘\n5. If there are multiple tables, concat them. Don’t give me reference or using '...', give me complete table!", "Q: how many blades of grass are on the st. jude campus? A:"],
